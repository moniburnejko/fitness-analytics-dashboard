# report overview
this document provides a detailed overview of the **fitness analytics dashboard** built in **looker studio**.  
the dashboard visualizes key health and activity metrics derived from the validated dataset `fitness_data_validation.xlsx` produced through the power query etl and validation pipeline.

## executive summary
the fitness analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of physical activity, workout habits, and recovery balance over time.  
it integrates multiple wellness dimensions - **activity consistency, workout intensity, sleep duration, and recovery quality** - into an interactive, dark-themed bi environment.

the dashboard serves as both:
- an **analytical tool** that identifies trends, correlations, and performance gaps, and  
- a **motivational tracker** highlighting personal progress and achievements   

it consists of three main analytical panels:
1. `performance panel` ‚Äì high-level overview of workouts, activity, and intensity distribution  
2. `workout analytics` ‚Äì detailed comparison of training types, durations, and efficiency  
3. `health & recovery` - correlation between rest, sleep, and workout performance  

the dashboard uses **automated data quality filters** (`valid data`, `complete data`) to ensure only verified records feed the visuals.  
cross-filtering, optional metrics, and tooltip-driven explanations allow for **multi-angle exploration** and intuitive storytelling of fitness performance.
